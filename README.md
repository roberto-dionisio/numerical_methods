## Numerical projects done for the course "Numerical Methods applied to Theoretical Physics"\
In particular there are three modulues which are:\
1. Monte Carlo Techniques applied to the study of a Statistical system, i.e. the 2D Ising model;\
2. Study and simple mitigation of the topological slowing down problem for a QM system of particle on a ring by means of PIMC;\
3. PIMC techniques applied to a free scalar field theory.\
